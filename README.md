# E-portfolio

This e-portfolio website has been developed as a comprehensive digital platform to present my academic background, technical skills, personal introduction, and professional journey in an organized and visually appealing manner. The primary objective of this portfolio is to create a well-structured online identity that effectively communicates my capabilities as a learner and aspiring technologist.

The website follows a clean and modern design philosophy, ensuring clarity, simplicity, and ease of navigation. The introduction section features a neatly styled content box containing my introductory details, positioned on the left side of the layout. Complementing this is a circular, well-cropped profile photograph on the right side, creating a balanced two-column presentation. Soft backgrounds, rounded corners, subtle shadows, and gentle transitions are incorporated to enhance readability and aesthetics while maintaining a professional tone.

A key highlight of the website is the integration of smooth scroll-based animations. The profile image gracefully appears when scrolling downward and fades while scrolling upward, contributing to a dynamic yet minimal user experience. These interactive elements are intentionally designed to be subtle, ensuring visual enhancement without overwhelming the viewer.

From a technical standpoint, the e-portfolio is built using standard and widely-used web technologies that ensure responsiveness and optimal performance across devices. The layout is structured using Flexbox to maintain proper alignment and adaptability on desktops, tablets, and mobile screens. CSS is utilized extensively for styling, animations, and effects, while JavaScript handles the interactive scroll-based transitions.
